				Get your (un)official 42 Silicon Valley certificate here! 
				Signed by Norminette and Moulinette, our dear and loved entities of this past institution.

			<p>
				This certficate is not valid, for anything, it's just to feel good about surviving the school.
			</p>
			<p>
				Wanted to make this happen because there were some people expecting some kind of paper
				after finishing school.
			</p>
			<p>
				But you must be a 42 Silicon Valley student, I need to make sure of that. Sorry :(
