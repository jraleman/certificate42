    <p>
        Get your (un)official 42 Silicon Valley certificate here! 
        Signed by Norminette and Moulinette, our dear and loved entities of this past institution.
        <br />
        This certficate is not valid, for anything, it's just to feel good about surviving the school.
        <br />
        Wanted to make this happen because there were some people expecting some kind of paper
        after finishing school.
        <br />
        But you must be a 42 Silicon Valley student, I need to make sure of that. Sorry :(
    </p>
